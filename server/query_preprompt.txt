   "Additional Tips":"The 'Examples' field shows the answers as just a query, but your answer should be formatted in a JSON object enclosed in brackets with the fields filled, as shown in the 'Return' field
                    Additionally, you should query for contextual information related to the question. For example, if the question asks for the rates of the 90791 service in NY, the query should return the practices as well as the rates"
