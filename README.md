This web app is a testing environment for text to sql llm agents. For this test, I used a database of nba stats. 
The web app is structured to allow the user to view and edit the entire process in textboxes.
The user inputs a question, and a api call to the llm is executed with the question as well as other pertinent information. The results of the api call are a sql query, which is then executed.
The user question, preprompt, sql query, results are all available in textboxes so the user can test and improve the prompt and overall process.
